#

> ## Repo Setup

<p align="justify">
To setup the repo, first fork the methcreate repo, then clone the forked repository to create a copy on the local machine.
</p>

    $ git clone https://github.com/EnebeliEmmanuel/methcreate.git

<p align="justify">
Change directory to the cloned repo and set the original Methcreate repository as the "upstream" and your forked repository as the "origin" using gitbash.
</p>

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/EnebeliEmmanuel/methcreate.git

#

> ## Requirements

#

- Hardhat
- Alchemy key
- Metamask key
- Etherscan.io API Url
- Node JS

#

> ## Setup the Project
>
> **`*Note:`**

<p align="justify">
This project was setup on a windows 10 system using the gitbash terminal. Some of the commands used may not work with the VScode terminal, command prompt or powershell.
</p>

The steps involved are outlined below:-

#

> ### Install Hardhat
>
> The first step involves cloning and installing hardhat.

```shell
$ cd Methcreate

$ npm i -D hardhat

$ npm install

$ npm install --save-dev "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle" "ethereum-waffle" "chai" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers" "ethers" "web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan" "@openzeppelin/contracts" "dotenv"

# If you encounter errors installing the dependencies above, delete the old package-lock.json and run the `npm install --save-dev` command again
```

> ## Create the SmartContract

- First write the Smartcontract codes within the contracts folder.
- The next step involves the compilation, deployment and verification of the contract on the testnet.

> ### Compile

- To compile the smartcontract before deployment:

```
$ npx hardhat compile
```

#

> ### Deploy

- To deploy the smartcontract:

```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

#

> ### Verify

> <<<<<<< HEAD

- First run the frontend on your local server to ensure it's fully functional before building for production.

#

> ### Install Dependencies

- Setup and install dependencies
  his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

> ## Testing the Smartcontract

- Coverage is used to view the percentage of the code required by tests and unittests were implemented to ensure that the code functions as expected

> ### Coverage

- Install Solidity Coverage

```
  $ npm i solidity-coverage
```

- Add `require('solidity-coverage')` to hardhat.config.json

- Install Ganache
